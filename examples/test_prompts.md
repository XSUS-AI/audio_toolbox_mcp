# Test Prompts for AudioProcessor Agent

## Audio Analysis Examples

1. "I have an MP3 file that I want to analyze. Can you help me understand what information I can extract from it?"

2. "Load the audio file 'sample.mp3' and tell me its duration, sample rate, and number of channels."

3. "Generate a spectrogram visualization for my audio to see its frequency content over time."

4. "I'd like to know if my music track has a consistent tempo. Can you detect the beats and tell me the BPM?"

5. "Extract the spectral features from my audio and explain what they mean."

## Audio Effects Examples

1. "I want to add some reverb to my audio file. What parameters can I adjust?"

2. "Apply reverb with a large room size and moderate damping to my loaded audio."

3. "I need to process my vocal recording with compression. Can you help me understand how that works?"

4. "Apply a chain of effects: first compression, then a slight reverb, and finally boost the gain by 3dB."

5. "I want to filter out the low frequencies in my audio. Can you apply a high-pass filter at 200Hz?"

## Audio Transformation Examples

1. "Can you slow down my audio by 20% without affecting the pitch?"

2. "I want to shift the pitch of my vocal track up by 2 semitones. How would I do that?"

3. "Resample my audio to 48kHz for better compatibility with my video editor."

4. "Normalize my audio to -1dB to make it louder without clipping."

5. "Can you apply a fade-in effect for the first 2 seconds and a fade-out for the last 3 seconds?"

## Audio Separation Examples

1. "I want to extract the vocals from my song. What separation models are available?"

2. "Separate my loaded music into vocals, drums, bass, and other components."

3. "Create a karaoke version of this song by removing the vocals."

4. "I just need to isolate the drums from this track for a remix."

5. "After separating the vocals, can you apply some reverb to just the vocal stem?"

## Complex Workflows

1. "Load my audio file, separate the vocals, apply compression and reverb to the vocals, then remix them with the instrumental."

2. "I need to analyze this song's tempo, then time-stretch it to exactly 120 BPM without changing the pitch."

3. "Extract the bass from this track, apply a low-pass filter at 200Hz, then boost the gain by 3dB before saving."

4. "Can you load my audio, generate both a spectrogram and chromagram, and explain what I'm looking at?"

5. "Take my song, separate the drums, reverse them, add some delay effect, and then mix them back with the original track."
